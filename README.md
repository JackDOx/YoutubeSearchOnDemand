# YoutubeSearchOnDemand
*A Google Chrome extension to add an additional search bar on Youtube webapp*

You are binging on a video. Suddenly, you have an urge to watch another video in mind - but you don't want to leave this video. Say no more, YoutubeSearchOnDemand (YSOD) is here to solve your problem!

This extension adds another search bar right above the related video tab on Youtube, allow you to search to your heart's content - all without leaving the current video!

Obviously, this only works on Youtube web application, and in fullscreen (other resolution *might* be supported in the future :D )

The extension was written in JavaScript, and I use Express as my back-end server/API whatever you wanna call it.
